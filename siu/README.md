The SIU (services-integration-utility) project.
===============================================

The aim of this project is to integrate several public APIs.

So far, the focus is to support both NASA's APOD API and Google's API Discovery service.

Using `Java EE`, for the application development, and `REST`, for the API invocation, the intention is to go enhancing this project, bit by bit, with more and more APIs.  

Future work will pass through the support of several other APIs that can be found [here](http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory) and [here](http://apis.io/).
