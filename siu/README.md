The SIU (services-integration-utility) project.
===============================================

The aim of this project is to integrate several public APIs.

So far, the focus is to support [NASA's](https://api.nasa.gov/) [APOD API](https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#apod).

Future work will pass through the support of several other APIs that can be found [here](http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory) or [here](http://apis.io/).
